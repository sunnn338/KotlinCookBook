🍳 Recipe: While Loop - The Automatic Stirrer

"Keep stirring until the soup is ready - that's a while loop!"

📖 What you'll learn:

· How to repeat actions while a condition is true
· Difference between while and do-while
· When to use each type

🥣 The Basic Recipe

```kotlin
/**
 * Recipe: WhileLoopBasics
 * What you'll learn: Repeat actions while condition is true
 */

fun main() {
    // Like stirring soup: keep stirring while it's NOT ready
    var soupReady = false
    var stirCount = 0
    
    while (!soupReady) {
        stirCount++
        println("Stirring soup... (stir #$stirCount)")
        
        if (stirCount >= 5) {
            soupReady = true
            println("✅ Soup is ready!")
        }
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Stirring soup... (stir #1)
Stirring soup... (stir #2)
Stirring soup... (stir #3)
Stirring soup... (stir #4)
Stirring soup... (stir #5)
✅ Soup is ready!
```

🔄 Two Types of Loops

1. While Loop - Check First, Then Cook

```kotlin
while (condition) {
    // This runs ONLY IF condition is true
    // Keep running UNTIL condition becomes false
}
```

Kitchen analogy: Check if you have eggs BEFORE making an omelette

```kotlin
var eggsInFridge = 3

while (eggsInFridge > 0) {
    println("🥚 Making an omelette...")
    eggsInFridge--  // Use one egg
    println("Eggs left: $eggsInFridge")
}
// When eggsInFridge becomes 0, loop stops
```

2. Do-While Loop - Cook First, Then Check

```kotlin
do {
    // This runs AT LEAST ONCE
    // Then check condition
} while (condition)
```

Kitchen analogy: Taste the soup FIRST, then decide if it needs more salt

```kotlin
var soupTasty = false
var saltAttempts = 0

do {
    println("🧂 Adding salt...")
    saltAttempts++
    
    if (saltAttempts >= 3) {
        soupTasty = true
        println("✅ Soup tastes good now!")
    }
} while (!soupTasty)
```

📊 While vs Do-While - The Difference

Feature while do-while
Check timing Before first run After first run
Minimum runs 0 (might never run) 1 (always runs once)
Use when Condition might be false initially Must run at least once

```kotlin
// WHILE: Might not run at all
var sugar = 0
while (sugar > 0) {
    println("This never prints because sugar is 0")
}

// DO-WHILE: Always runs at least once
do {
    println("This prints once even though sugar is 0")
} while (sugar > 0)
```

🍲 Real Kitchen Examples

Example 1: Waiting for Water to Boil

```kotlin
fun waitForWaterToBoil() {
    var waterTemperature = 25  // Starting at 25°C
    val boilingPoint = 100
    
    while (waterTemperature < boilingPoint) {
        println("🌡️ Water at ${waterTemperature}°C - not boiling yet")
        waterTemperature += 15  // Heating up
        Thread.sleep(500)  // Small pause to simulate time
    }
    println("💨 Water is boiling! Time for pasta!")
}

fun main() {
    waitForWaterToBoil()
}
```

Example 2: Cutting Vegetables

```kotlin
fun chopVegetables() {
    var vegetables = listOf("🥕 Carrot", "🧅 Onion", "🥔 Potato", "🌶️ Pepper")
    var chopped = mutableListOf<String>()
    
    while (vegetables.isNotEmpty()) {
        val current = vegetables.first()
        println("🔪 Chopping $current...")
        chopped.add(current)
        vegetables = vegetables.drop(1)  // Remove chopped vegetable
        
        println("   Remaining: ${vegetables.size} vegetables")
    }
    
    println("✅ All vegetables chopped! $chopped")
}

fun main() {
    chopVegetables()
}
```

Example 3: Password Check (Do-While)

```kotlin
fun secretRecipeAccess() {
    val secretCode = "cook123"
    var attempts = 0
    var input: String
    
    do {
        println("🔐 Enter secret recipe code (attempt ${attempts + 1}/3):")
        input = readln()
        attempts++
        
        if (input != secretCode) {
            println("❌ Wrong code!")
        }
    } while (input != secretCode && attempts < 3)
    
    if (input == secretCode) {
        println("📖 Access granted! Here's the secret recipe...")
    } else {
        println("🚫 Too many attempts! Kitchen locked!")
    }
}
```

🎯 Try It Yourself!

Challenge 1: Countdown Timer

Create a countdown from 10 to 1, then print "🎉 Happy Cooking!"

<details>
<summary>👨‍🍳 Click for solution</summary>```kotlin
fun countdown() {
    var timer = 10
    while (timer > 0) {
        println("⏰ $timer...")
        timer--
        Thread.sleep(1000)
    }
    println("🎉 Happy Cooking!")
}
```

</details>Challenge 2: Guess the Ingredient

Generate a random number (1-5) representing an ingredient. Let user guess until correct.

<details>
<summary>👨‍🍳 Click for solution</summary>```kotlin
fun guessIngredient() {
    val secret = (1..5).random()
    var guess = 0
    
    println("Guess the ingredient number (1-5):")
    
    while (guess != secret) {
        print("Your guess: ")
        guess = readln().toInt()
        
        if (guess < secret) println("⬆️ Too low! Try higher")
        else if (guess > secret) println("⬇️ Too high! Try lower")
        else println("🎉 Correct! That's the secret ingredient!")
    }
}
```

</details>Challenge 3: Recipe Cost Calculator

Keep adding ingredient costs until user types "done", then show total.

<details>
<summary>👨‍🍳 Click for solution</summary>```kotlin
fun calculateCost() {
    var total = 0.0
    var input: String
    
    println("💰 Enter ingredient costs (type 'done' to finish):")
    
    do {
        print("Cost: ")
        input = readln()
        
        if (input.lowercase() != "done") {
            val cost = input.toDoubleOrNull()
            if (cost != null && cost > 0) {
                total += cost
                println("   Added: $$cost (Total: $$total)")
            } else {
                println("   ❌ Invalid amount! Use numbers like 2.99")
            }
        }
    } while (input.lowercase() != "done")
    
    println("💵 Total recipe cost: $$total")
}
```

🚨 Common Mistakes (Kitchen Fires)

Mistake What Happens How to Fix
Infinite loop Code runs forever! 😱 Make sure condition eventually becomes false
kotlin while (true) { println("Stuck!") }  Never stops Add a way to break or change condition
Forgetting to update Condition never changes Update your variable inside the loop
kotlin var count = 0 while (count < 5) { // forgot count++ }  Infinite loop! Add count++
Wrong condition Loop never runs Check your logic (use >, <, ==, !=)
Using = instead of == Assignment, not comparison Use == for comparison

---

💡 Pro Tips

1. Always have an exit strategy - Ensure your condition will eventually become false
2. Use break for emergencies - Exit loop immediately if something goes wrong
3. Use continue to skip - Jump to next iteration without finishing current
4. When in doubt, add print statements - Debug by printing values each iteration

```kotlin
// Emergency break example
var attempts = 0
while (true) {  // Looks infinite, but...
    if (attempts >= 10) {
        println("Too many attempts! Breaking out!")
        break  // Emergency exit!
    }
    attempts++
}
```

🍽️ When to Use While vs Other Loops

Situation Best Choice Why
Unknown number of iterations while Keep going until condition met
Must run at least once do-while Check after first run
Known number of iterations for loop Cleaner syntax
Loop through collection for or forEach More readable
Infinite until event while(true) + break Clear intent

📚 What's Next?

Now that you know how to stir automatically (while loops), you're ready to learn:

· For loops - When you know exactly how many times to stir
· Break & Continue - How to stop early or skip steps
· Nested loops - Stirring multiple pots at once!
