> *"Learn Kotlin the fun way – one recipe at a time!"*

## What is it?

This is a simple **Kotlin CookBook** that helps you learn Kotlin **easier** and **funner**.

Each "recipe" is a small Kotlin program that teaches you one concept at a time.

> [!NOTE]
> This repo is still incomplete and I'm just learning Kotlin now, so if you can, please help me complete it by **forking** and adding new **recipes**. All code here is **safe** and **stable**.

## 🚀 How to cook (run) these recipes

```bash
# Clone the kitchen
git clone https://github.com/realmg51-cpu/KotlinCookBook
cd KotlinCookBook

# Run a recipe
kotlin src/kotlin/normal/HelloWorld.kt

# Or run with Java (if Kotlin is not in PATH)
kotlinc -script src/kotlin/normal/HelloWorld.kt
```

### Running interactive examples:

Some recipes use `readln()` to get input from you. Just follow the prompts!

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### Phase 1: Kotlin Basics (In Progress)
- [x] Hello World
- [x] String manipulation
- [x] Variables (`val` vs `var`)
- [x] Data types (Int, Char, String, Float, Double)
- [x] `if-else` decisions
- [x] `when` expression
- [ ] Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Null safety (`?`, `?:`, `!!`)

### Phase 2: Intermediate
- [ ] Collections (List, Set, Map)
- [ ] Lambdas and higher-order functions
- [ ] Scope functions (`let`, `run`, `with`, `apply`, `also`)
- [ ] Extension functions

### Phase 3: Advanced
- [ ] Coroutines (async cooking!)
- [ ] Kotlin 2.2.0 features
- [ ] Android development basics
- [ ] Multiplatform Magic

## 📖 How to Use This CookBook

1. **Start from the top** – recipes build on each other
2. **Type the code yourself** – don't just copy-paste!
3. **Experiment** – change values and see what happens
4. **Try the challenges** – they make you a better chef
5. **Break things** – then fix them. That's how you learn!

---

## 🆘 Common Mistakes (and how to fix them)

| Mistake | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `println("Hello)` (missing quote) | Always close your quotes: `"Hello"` |
| `val name = "John"; name = "Jane"` | Use `var` if you need to change it |
| `if (isSalty == true)` | Just write `if (isSalty)` |
| Missing `else` in `when` expression | Add `else -> ...` at the end |
| `Float` without `f` (`3.14`) | Kotlin thinks it's `Double`. Use `3.14f` |
| `Char` with double quotes (`"a"`) | Use single quotes: `'a'` |
